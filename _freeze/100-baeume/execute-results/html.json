vergleichen.\nDer Unterschied zu Entscheidungsbäumen im maschinellen Lernen ist nur,\ndass die Regeln aus den Daten gelernt werden, man muss sie nicht vorab kennen.\n\n\n\nNoch ein Beispiel ist in  @fig-tree3 gezeigt [@islr]: \nOben links zeigt eine *unmögliche* Partionierung (für einen Entscheidungsbaum). \nOben rechts zeigt die Regionen, \ndie sich durch den Entscheidungsbaum unten links ergeben.\nUntenrechts ist der Baum in 3D dargestellt.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='100-baeume_cache/html/fig-tree3_ef67124c698bd7fbe887fd363d5cc901'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Ein weiteres Beispiel zur Darstellung von Entscheidungsbäumen](img/8.3.png){#fig-tree3 width=1202}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Klassifikation\n\n\nBäume können für Zwecke der Klassifikation (nominal skalierte AV) oder Regression (numerische AV) verwendet werden.\nBetrachten wir zunächst die binäre Klassifikation, also für eine zweistufige (nominalskalierte) AV.\nDas Ziel des Entscheidungsmodel-Algorithmus ist es,\nzu Blättern zu kommen, die möglichst \"sortenrein\" sind, \nsich also möglichst klar für eine (der beiden) Klassen $A$ oder $B$ aussprechen.\nNach dem Motto: \"Wenn Prädiktor 1 kleiner $x$ und wenn Prädiktor 2 gleich $y$,\ndann handelt es sich beim vorliegenden Fall ziemlich sicher um Klasse $A$.\"\n\n\n:::: {.infobox .quote}\nJe homogener die Verteilung der AV pro Blatt, desto genauer die Vorhersagen.\n:::\n\n\nUnsere Vorhersage in einem Blatt entspricht der Merheit bzw. der häufigsten Kategorie in diesem Blatt.\n\n\n### Gini als Optimierungskriterium\n\nEs gibt mehrere Kennzahlen, die zur Optimierung bzw. zur Entscheidung zum Aufbau des Entscheidungsbaum herangezogen werden.\nZwei übliche sind der *Gini-Koeffizient* und die *Entropie*.\nBei Kennzahlen sind Maß für die Homogenität oder \"Sortenreinheit\" (vs. Heterogenität, engl. auch impurity).\n\nDen Algorithmus zur Erzeugung des Baumes kann man so darstellen:\n\n```\nWiederhole für jede Ebenes\n|  prüfe für alle Prädiktoren alle möglichen Bedingungen\n|  wähle denjenigen Prädiktor mit derjenigen Bedingung, der die Homogenität maximiert\nsolange bis Abbruchkriterium erreicht ist.\n```\n\nEin Bedingung könnte sein `Age >= 18` oder `Years < 4.5`.\n\nEs kommen mehrere Abbruchkriterium in Frage:\n\n- Eine Mindestanzahl von Beobachtungen pro Knoten wird unterschritten (`minsplit`)\n- Die maximale Anzahl an Ebenen ist erreicht (`maxdepth`)\n- Die minimale Zahl an Beobachtungen eines Blatts wird unterschritten (`minbucket`)\n\n\n\nDer Gini-Koeffizient ist im Fall einer UV mit zwei Stufen, $c_A$ und $c_B$, so definiert:\n\n$$G = 1 - \\left(p(c_A)^2 + (1-p(c_A))^2\\right)$$\n\n\nDer Algorithmus ist \"gierig\" (greedy): Optimiert werden lokal optimale Aufteilungen,\nauch wenn das bei späteren Aufteilungen im Baum dann insgesamt zu geringerer Homogenität führt.\n\n\nDie Entropie ist definiert als \n\n$$D = - \\sum_{k=1}^K p_k \\cdot log(p_k),$$\n\nwobei $K$ die Anzahl der Kategorien indiziert.\n\nGini-Koeffizient und Entropie kommen oft zu ähnlichen numerischen Ergebnissen,\nso dass wir uns im Folgenden auf den Gini-Koeffizienten konzentieren werden.\n\n---\n\n*Beispiel*\n\nVergleichen wir drei Bedingungen mit jeweils $n=20$ Fällen, die zu unterschiedlich homogenen Knoten führen:\n\n- 10/10\n- 15/5\n- 19/1\n\nWas ist jeweils der Wert des Gini-Koeffizienten?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='100-baeume_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-7_04d6f2e3df684560e906c17406f0d5a6'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nG1 <- 1 - ((10/20)^2 + (10/20)^2)\nG1\n## [1] 0.5\n\nG2 <- 1 - ((15/20)^2 + (5/20)^2)\nG2\n## [1] 0.375\n\nG3 <- 1 - ((19/20)^2 + (1/20)^2)\nG3\n## [1] 0.095\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWie man sieht, sinkt der Wert des Gini-Koeffizienten (\"G-Wert\"), je homogener die Verteilung ist.\n*Maximal* heterogen (\"gemischt\") ist die Verteilung, wenn alle Werte gleich oft vorkommen,\nin diesem Fall also 50%/50%.\n\n\n---\n\n\nNeben dem G-Wert für einzelne Knoten kann man den G-Wert für eine Aufteilung (\"Split\") berechnen,\nalso die Fraeg beantworten, ob die Aufteilung eines Knoten in zwei zu mehr Homogenität führt.\nDer G-Wert einer Aufteilung ist die gewichtete Summe der G-Werte der beiden Knoten (links, $l$ und rechts, $r$):\n\n\n$$G_{split} = p(l) G_{l} + p(r) G_r$$\n\nDer *Gewinn* (gain) an Homogenität ist dann die Differenz des G-Werts der kleineren Ebene und der Aufteilung:\n\n\n$$G_{gain} = G - G_{split}$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDer Algorithmus kann auch bei UV mit mehr als zwei, also $K$ Stufen, $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_K$ verwendet werden:\n\n\n$$G= 1- \\sum_{k=1}^K p(c_k)^2$$ \n\n\n\n### Metrische Prädiktoren\n\n\nAußerdem ist es möglich, Bedingung  bei *metrischen* UV auf ihre Homogenität hin zu bewerten,\nalso Aufteilungen der Art `Years < 4.5` zu tätigen. \nDazu muss man einen Wert identifieren, bei dem man auftrennt.\n\nDas geht in etwa so:\n\n```\nSortiere die Werte eines Prädiktors (aufsteigend)\nFür jedes Paar an aufeinanderfolgenden Werten berechne den G-Wert\nFinde das Paar mit dem höchsten G-Wert aus allen Paaren\nNimm den Mittelwert der beiden Werte dieses Paares: Das ist der Aufteilungswert\n```\n\n\nAbbildung @fig-tree-metr stellt dieses Vorgehen schematisch dar [@rhys].\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='100-baeume_cache/html/fig-tree-metr_d9ccfea01025e82cfbea7d59e9793a6d'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Aufteilungswert bei metrischen Prädiktoren](img/fig7-5_alt.jpeg){#fig-tree-metr width=295}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Regressionbäume\n\nBei Regressionsbäumen wird nicht ein Homogenitätsmaß wie der Gini-Koeffizient als Optimierungskriterium\nherangezogen, sondern die *RSS* (Residual Sum of Squares) bietet sich an.\n\nDie $J$ Regionen (Partionierungen) des Prädiktorraums $R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_J$ müssen so gewählt werden,\ndass RSS minimal ist:\n\n\n$$RSS = \\sum^J_{j=1}\\sum_{i\\in R_j}(u_i - \\hat{y}_{R_j})^2,$$\n\nwobei $\\hat{y}$ der (vom Baum) vorhergesagte Wert ist für die $j$-te Region.\n\n\n## Baum beschneiden\n\nEin Problem mit Entscheidungsbäumen ist,\ndass ein zu komplexer Baum, \"zu verästelt\" sozusagen,\nin hohem Maße Overfitting ausgesetzt ist:\nBei höheren Ebenen im Baum ist die Anzahl der Beobachtungen zwangsläufig klein,\nwas bedeutet, dass viel Rauschen gefittet wird.\n\nUm das Overfitting zu vermeiden, gibt es zwei auf der Hand liegende Maßnahmen:\n\n1. Den Baum nicht so groß werden lassen\n2. Den Baum \"zurückschneiden\"\n\nDie 1. Maßnahme beruht auf dem Festlegen einer maximalen Zahl an Ebenen (`maxdepth`) oder einer minimalen Zahl an Fällen pro Knoten (`minsplit`) oder im Blatt (`minbucket`).\n\n\nDie 2. Maßnahme, das Zurückschneiden (pruning) des Baumes hat als Idee, einen \"Teilbaum\" $T$ zu finden,\nder so klein wie möglich ist, aber so gut wie möglich präzise Vorhersagen erlaubt.\nDazu belegen wir die RSS eines Teilbaums (subtree) mit einem Strafterm $s = \\alpha |T|$,\nwobei $|T|$ die Anzahl der Blätter des Baums entspricht. $\\alpha$ ist ein Tuningparameter,\nalso ein Wert, der nicht vom Modell berechnet wird, sondern von uns gesetzt werden muss -\nzumeist durch schlichtes Ausprobieren.\n$\\alpha$ wägt ab zwischen Komplexität und Fit (geringe RSS).\nWenn $\\alpha=0$ haben wir eine normalen, unbeschnittenen Baum $T_0$.\nJe größer $\\alpha$ wird, desto höher wird der \"Preis\" für viele Blätter, also für Komplexität\nund der Baum wird kleiner.\nDieses Vorgehen nennt man auch *cost complexity pruning*.\nDaher nennt man den zugehörigen Tuningparameter auch *Cost Complexity* $C_p$.\n\n\n\n## Das Rechteck schlägt zurück\n\n\nEntscheidungsbäume zeichnen sich durch rechtecke (rekursive) Partionierungen des Prädiktorenraums aus.\nLineare Modelle durch eine einfache lineare Partionierung (wenn man Klassifizieren möchte),\n @fig-rechteck verdeutlicht diesen Unterschied [@islr].\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='100-baeume_cache/html/fig-rechteck_8a3ebbecf5879dc0093797f55eec297e'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Rechteckige vs. lineare Partionierung](img/8.7.png){#fig-rechteck width=1202}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nJetzt kann sich fragen: Welches Vorgehen ist besser - das rechteckige oder das lineare Partionierungen.\nDa gibt es eine klare Antwort: Es kommt drauf an.\nWie  @fig-rechteck gibt es Datenlagen, in denen das eine Vorgehen zu homogenerer Klassifikation führt\nund Situationen, in denen das andere Vorgehen besser ist.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='100-baeume_cache/html/fig-lunch_f6937342161b115518a23aebf7ef6755'}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tidymodels\n\n\nProbieren wir den Algorithmus Entscheidungsbäume an einem einfachen Beispiel in R mit Tidymodels aus.\n\nDie Aufgabe sei, Spritverbrauch (möglichst exakt) vorherzusagen.\n\nEin ähnliches Beispiel, mit analogem Vorgehen, findet sich in [dieser Fallstude](https://juliasilge.com/blog/wind-turbine/).\n\n\n\n### Initiale Datenaufteilung\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='100-baeume_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-8_4c5a4b1d58fd46a75dfb5d05dbef8bff'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='100-baeume_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-9_3380e539fa6cce6c15dc556233bfc53b'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(\"mtcars\")\n\nset.seed(42)  # Reproduzierbarkeit\nd_split <- initial_split(mtcars, strata = mpg)\n## Warning: The number of observations in each quantile is below the recommended threshold of 20.\n## • Stratification will use 1 breaks instead.\n## Warning: Too little data to stratify.\n## • Resampling will be unstratified.\n\nd_train <- training(d_split)\nd_test <- testing(d_split)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nDie Warnung zeigt uns, dass der Datensatz sehr klein ist; stimmt.
