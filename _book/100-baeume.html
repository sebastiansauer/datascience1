<p>Ein Baum 🌳 hat (u.a.):</p>
<ul>
<li>Wurzel</li>
<li>Blätter</li>
<li>Äste</li>
</ul>
<p>In einem <em>Entscheidungsbaum</em> ist die Terminologie ähnlich, s. <a href="#fig-rec-part2">Abbildung&nbsp;<span>10.1</span></a>. Allgemein gesagt, kann ein Entscheidungsbaum in einem baumähnlichen Graphen visualisiert werden. Dort gibt es Knoten, die durch Kanten verbunden sind, wobei zu einem Knoten genau ein Kanten führt.</p>

<p>In <a href="#fig-rec-part2">Abbildung&nbsp;<span>10.1</span></a> wird der Knoten an der Spitze auch als <em>Wurzel(knoten)</em> bezeichnet. Von diesem Knoten entspringen alle Pfade. Ein Pfad ist die geordnete Menge der Pfade mit ihren Knoten ausgehend von der Wurzel bis zu einem Blatt. Knoten, aus denen kein Kanten mehr wegführt (“Endknoten”) werden als <em>Blätter</em> bezeichnet. Von einem Knoten gehen zwei Kanten aus (oder gar keine). Knoten, von denen zwei Kanten ausgehen, spiegeln eine <em>Bedingung</em> (Prüfung) wider, im Sinne einer Aussage, die mit ja oder nein beantwortet werden kann. Die Anzahl der Knoten eines Pfads entsprechen den <em>Ebenen</em> bzw. der Tiefe des Baumes. Von der obersten Ebene (Wurzelknoten) kann man die <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> Ebenen aufsteigend durchnummerieren, beginnend bei 1: <span class="math inline">\(1,2,\ldots,e\)</span>.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">10.3</span> Klassifikation</h2>
<p>Bäume können für Zwecke der Klassifikation (nominal skalierte AV) oder Regression (numerische AV) verwendet werden. Betrachten wir zunächst die binäre Klassifikation, also für eine zweistufige (nominalskalierte) AV. Das Ziel des Entscheidungsmodel-Algorithmus ist es, zu Blättern zu kommen, die möglichst “sortenrein” sind, sich also möglichst klar für eine (der beiden) Klassen <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> oder <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> aussprechen. Nach dem Motto: “Wenn Prädiktor 1 kleiner <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> und wenn Prädiktor 2 gleich <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, dann handelt es sich beim vorliegenden Fall ziemlich sicher um Klasse <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.”</p>
<div class="infobox quote">

<span class="header-section-number">10.3.1</span> Gini als Optimierungskriterium</h3>
<p>Es gibt mehrere Kennzahlen, die zur Optimierung bzw. zur Entscheidung zum Aufbau des Entscheidungsbaum herangezogen werden. Zwei übliche sind der <em>Gini-Koeffizient</em> und die <em>Entropie</em>. Bei Kennzahlen sind Maß für die Homogenität oder “Sortenreinheit” (vs.&nbsp;Heterogenität, engl. auch impurity).</p>
<p>Den Algorithmus zur Erzeugung des Baumes kann man so darstellen:</p>
<pre><code>Wiederhole für jede Ebenes
|  prüfe für alle Prädiktoren alle möglichen Bedingungen
|  wähle denjenigen Prädiktor mit derjenigen Bedingung, der die Homogenität maximiert
solange bis Abbruchkriterium erreicht ist.</code></pre>
<p>Ein Bedingung könnte sein <code>Age &gt;= 18</code> oder <code>Years &lt; 4.5</code>.</p>
<p>Es kommen mehrere Abbruchkriterium in Frage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eine Mindestanzahl von Beobachtungen pro Knoten wird unterschritten (<code>minsplit</code>)</li>
<li>Die maximale Anzahl an Ebenen ist erreicht (<code>maxdepth</code>)</li>
<li>Die minimale Zahl an Beobachtungen eines Blatts wird unterschritten (<code>minbucket</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Der Gini-Koeffizient ist im Fall einer UV mit zwei Stufen, <span class="math inline">\(c_A\)</span> und <span class="math inline">\(c_B\)</span>, so definiert:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[G = 1 - \left(p(c_A)^2 + (1-p(c_A))^2\right)\]</span></p>
<p>Der Algorithmus ist “gierig” (greedy): Optimiert werden lokal optimale Aufteilungen, auch wenn das bei späteren Aufteilungen im Baum dann insgesamt zu geringerer Homogenität führt.</p>
<p>Die Entropie ist definiert als</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[D = - \sum_{k=1}^K p_k \cdot log(p_k),\]</span></p>
<p>wobei <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> die Anzahl der Kategorien indiziert.</p>
<p>Gini-Koeffizient und Entropie kommen oft zu ähnlichen numerischen Ergebnissen, so dass wir uns im Folgenden auf den Gini-Koeffizienten konzentieren werden.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Beispiel</em></p>
<p>Vergleichen wir drei Bedingungen mit jeweils <span class="math inline">\(n=20\)</span> Fällen, die zu unterschiedlich homogenen Knoten führen:</p>
<ul>
<li>10/10</li>
<li>15/5</li>
<li>19/1</li>
</ul>
<p>Was ist jeweils der Wert des Gini-Koeffizienten?</p>

<p>Wie man sieht, sinkt der Wert des Gini-Koeffizienten (“G-Wert”), je homogener die Verteilung ist. <em>Maximal</em> heterogen (“gemischt”) ist die Verteilung, wenn alle Werte gleich oft vorkommen, in diesem Fall also 50%/50%.</p>
<hr>
<p>Neben dem G-Wert für einzelne Knoten kann man den G-Wert für eine Aufteilung (“Split”) berechnen, also die Fraeg beantworten, ob die Aufteilung eines Knoten in zwei zu mehr Homogenität führt. Der G-Wert einer Aufteilung ist die gewichtete Summe der G-Werte der beiden Knoten (links, <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> und rechts, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[G_{split} = p(l) G_{l} + p(r) G_r\]</span></p>
<p>Der <em>Gewinn</em> (gain) an Homogenität ist dann die Differenz des G-Werts der kleineren Ebene und der Aufteilung:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[G_{gain} = G - G_{split}\]</span></p>
<p>Der Algorithmus kann auch bei UV mit mehr als zwei, also <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> Stufen, <span class="math inline">\(c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_K\)</span> verwendet werden:</p>

<p>Außerdem ist es möglich, Bedingung bei <em>metrischen</em> UV auf ihre Homogenität hin zu bewerten, also Aufteilungen der Art <code>Years &lt; 4.5</code> zu tätigen. Dazu muss man einen Wert identifieren, bei dem man auftrennt.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">10.5</span> Baum beschneiden</h2>
<p>Ein Problem mit Entscheidungsbäumen ist, dass ein zu komplexer Baum, “zu verästelt” sozusagen, in hohem Maße Overfitting ausgesetzt ist: Bei höheren Ebenen im Baum ist die Anzahl der Beobachtungen zwangsläufig klein, was bedeutet, dass viel Rauschen gefittet wird.</p>
<p>Um das Overfitting zu vermeiden, gibt es zwei auf der Hand liegende Maßnahmen:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Den Baum nicht so groß werden lassen</li>
<li>Den Baum “zurückschneiden”</li>
</ol>
<p>Die 1. Maßnahme beruht auf dem Festlegen einer maximalen Zahl an Ebenen (<code>maxdepth</code>) oder einer minimalen Zahl an Fällen pro Knoten (<code>minsplit</code>) oder im Blatt (<code>minbucket</code>).</p>
<p>Die 2. Maßnahme, das Zurückschneiden (pruning) des Baumes hat als Idee, einen “Teilbaum” <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> zu finden, der so klein wie möglich ist, aber so gut wie möglich präzise Vorhersagen erlaubt. Dazu belegen wir die RSS eines Teilbaums (subtree) mit einem Strafterm <span class="math inline">\(s = \alpha |T|\)</span>, wobei <span class="math inline">\(|T|\)</span> die Anzahl der Blätter des Baums entspricht. <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> ist ein Tuningparameter, also ein Wert, der nicht vom Modell berechnet wird, sondern von uns gesetzt werden muss - zumeist durch schlichtes Ausprobieren. <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> wägt ab zwischen Komplexität und Fit (geringe RSS). Wenn <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0\)</span> haben wir eine normalen, unbeschnittenen Baum <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span>. Je größer <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> wird, desto höher wird der “Preis” für viele Blätter, also für Komplexität und der Baum wird kleiner. Dieses Vorgehen nennt man auch <em>cost complexity pruning</em>. Daher nennt man den zugehörigen Tuningparameter auch <em>Cost Complexity</em> <span class="math inline">\(C_p\)</span>.</p>

<p>Die Warnung zeigt uns, dass der Datensatz sehr klein ist; stimmt. Ignorieren wir hier einfach.</p>
<p>Wie man auf der <a href="https://rsample.tidymodels.org/reference/initial_split.html">Hilfeseite der Funktion</a> sieht, wird per Voreinstellung 3/1 aufgeteilt, also 75% in das Train-Sample, 25% der Daten ins Test-Sample.</p>
<p>Bei <span class="math inline">\(n=32\)</span> finden also 8 Autos ihren Weg ins Test-Sample und die übrigen 24 ins Train-Sample. Bei der kleinen Zahl könnte man sich (berechtigterweise) fragen, ob es Sinn macht, die spärlichen Daten noch mit einem Test-Sample weiter zu dezimieren. Der Einwand ist nicht unberechtigt, allerdings zieht der Verzicht auf ein Test-Sample andere Probleme, Overfitting namentlich, nach sich.</p>

<p>Wenn Sie sich fragen, woher Sie die Optionen für die Tuningparameter wissen sollen: Schauen Sie mal in die <a href="https://dials.tidymodels.org/articles/Basics.html">Hilfeseite des Pakets {{dials}}</a>; das Paket ist Teil von Tidymodels.</p>
<p>Die Berechnung des Modells läuft über das Paket <code>{{rpart}}</code>, was wir durch <code>set_engine()</code> festgelegt haben.</p>
<p>Der Parameter <em>Cost Complexity</em>, <span class="math inline">\(C_p\)</span> oder manchmal auch mit <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> bezeichnet, hat einen typischen Wertebereich von <span class="math inline">\(10^{-10}\)</span> bis <span class="math inline">\(10^{-1}\)</span>:</p>

<p>Unser Modell ist also so definiert:</p>

<p>Mit <code>tune()</code> weist man den betreffenden Parameter als “zu tunen” aus - gute Werte sollen durch Ausprobieren während des Berechnens bestimmt werden. Genauer gesagt soll das Modell für jeden Wert (oder jede Kombination an Werten von Tuningparametern) berechnet werden.</p>
<p>Eine Kombination an Tuningparameter-Werten, die ein Modell spezifizieren, sozusagen erst “fertig definieren”, nennen wir einen <em>Modellkandidaten</em>.</p>
<p>Definieren wir also eine Tabelle (<code>grid</code>) mit Werten, die ausprobiert, “getuned” werden sollen. Wir haben oben dre Tuningparameter bestimmt. Sagen wir, wir hätten gerne jeweils 5 Werte pro Parameter.</p>

<p>Für jeden Parameter sind Wertebereiche definiert; dieser Wertebereich wird gleichmäßig (daher <code>grid regular</code>) aufgeteilt; die Anzahl der verschiedenen Werte pro Parameter wird druch <code>levels</code> gegeben.</p>
<p>Mehr dazu findet sich auf der <a href="https://dials.tidymodels.org/reference/grid_regular.html">Hilfeseite</a> zu <code>grid_regular()</code>.</p>
<p>Wenn man die alle miteinander durchprobiert, entstehen <span class="math inline">\(4^3\)</span> Kombinationen, also Modellkandidaten.</p>
<p>Allgemeiner gesagt sind das bei <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> Tuningparametern mit jeweils <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> verschiedenen Werten <span class="math inline">\(m^n\)</span> Möglichkeiten, spricht Modellkandidaten. Um diesen Faktor erhöht sich die Rechenzeit im Vergleich zu einem Modell ohne Tuning. Man sieht gleich, dass die Rechenzeit schnell unangenehm lang werden kann.</p>
<p>Entsprechend hat unsere Tabelle diese Zahl an Zeilen. Jede Zeile definiert einen Modellkandidaten, also eine Berechnung des Modells.</p>

<p>Das Zwischenspeichern von Modellobjekten ist praktisch, weil es Rechenzeit spart. Allerdings hat es auch Nachteile: Wenn Sie Ihre Modellspezifikation ändern, müssen Sie auch Ihr gespeichertes Modell aktualisieren. Das vergisst man leicht. Dann hat man falsche Ergebnisse und man wird nicht durch eine Fehlermeldung gewarnt.</p>

<p>Voilà: Die Modellgüte für das Test-Sample: Im Schnitt liegen wir ca. 4 Meilen daneben mit unseren Vorhersagen, wenn wir RMSE mal so locker interpretieren wollen.</p>
<p>In der Regel ist übrigens RMSE interessanter als R-Quadrat, da R-Quadrat die Güte eines Korrelationsmusters vorhersagt, aber RMSE die Präzision der Vorhersage, also sozusagen die Kürze der Fehlerbalken.</p>
